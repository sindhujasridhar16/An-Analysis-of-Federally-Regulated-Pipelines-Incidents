Analysis of Federally Regulated Pipelines Incidents

Background: The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) quarterly publishes a dataset on pipeline incidents spanning from 2008 to the present. To streamline data preparation, I utilized Python scripting to clean the dataset, removing unnecessary columns. Additionally, I replicated the cleaning process efficiently in Alteryx, leveraging its intuitive workflow for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tasks.

Data Source: Access the dataset on the Open Government website [ [here] (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7dffedc4-23fa-440c-a36d-adf5a6cc09f1)].

Efficiency with Alteryx: With an engineering background, I found Alteryx to be an intuitive tool for data analysis. Its workflow streamlines importing, cleaning, and exporting data, significantly reducing data preparation timeâ€”by approximately 90%.

Visualization in Tableau: I recently uploaded a dashboard to Tableau Public, providing insights into pipeline incidents.

Key Takeaway: Utilizing a combination of Alteryx workflows, and Tableau visualizations has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of analyzing federally regulated pipeline incidents data.
